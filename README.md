# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Description

BookBot is a simple program designed to help users analyze text files. It reads a text file, counts the frequency of each word, and provides useful statistics such as the total word count and the most common words.

## How It Works

1. The user provides a text file as input.
2. BookBot processes the file, removing punctuation and converting all text to lowercase for consistency.
3. It calculates word frequencies and generates a summary of the text.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tozalas/boot.dev/bookbot.git
    cd bookbot
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python bookbot.py <path_to_text_file>
    ```

3. View the output, which includes word frequency statistics and other text analysis results.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the program.
